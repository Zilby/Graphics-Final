Video Notes:

- Added transparency to objects using blending. 
	- Realized we needed to support transparent images so we imported a class to load PNGs
	- Realized we couldn't render semi-transparency without sorting the transparent objects 
	(which was not done via the Scene Node structure) so we added a Blending class to do so. 

- Added parsing of quads in obj files. 

- Added billboarding to particles so that they'd face camera when adjusted from the side. 
	- Had to modify billboarding code when we realized it didn't take the projection matrix into account. 

- Added a particle generator class that created smaller particle scene nodes which had features such as fading, 
moving via velocity, color, etc. 

- Modified particle code to take in an object and a shader so that they could be recycled (vastly improving performance).
