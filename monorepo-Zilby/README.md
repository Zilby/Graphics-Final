# Welcome! (How to do well in this class)

Welcome to Computer Graphics!

Read. Always read the text provided in the assignments and lab. They are carefully laid out for a reason. Very often I can tell who has read and not read any of the text, as the above section will not be edited with your name. :) Please do that now.

Beyond that generic but true advice, the second thing I advise is be engaged in the class. Use class time to follow along and work. Consistently showing up and writing at the very least one thing you learned during the lectures/labs is an excellent way to do well in this course.

This can be a demanding course. It is not intentionally designed to be tricky. I'm designing this course to be on par with courses at MIT, Stanford, Utah, and other institutions where graphics is their speciality. That is a high bar. That means we will get to do some realyl cool projects! I hope some of you will land your dream jobs at game companies, Pixar, Dreamworks, etc. Everyone will leave this class a better graphics programmer.

## Learning git
If you are not familiar with git, you can quickly learn the basics of how it works in about 15 minutes.

## github and this course

This course utilizes git because:

- It is good real world skill to have.
- It is easy for me to monitor your progress and receive your assignments for grading.
  - (You will also never e-mail me code snippets, I can just look!)
- In order to receive your assignments, you simply do 'git pull' after I have released them.
  - This will make sense after trying the tutorial if you are new to git.

That being said, I can only grade what you have **pushed** to your repo. Make sure to push your latest changes to your repo. The timestamp tells me when your file was submitted as well.

### FAQ

- Q: May I upload the github to a public repository for prospective employers to see?
  - A: **No**. You may not upload any assignments or labs. This is for your protection in case assignments or parts of assignments are reused. You *may* list the assignments on your resume/CV if you like. You could additionally provide a webpage describing the project, showing screenshots, and discussing high-level ideas of how you solved the project.
- (Applicable only to my courses with final projects)  
- Q: May I upload my final project to a public repository after the semester is over?
  - A: **Yes under the following conditions**
    - You acknowledge your team members and any third parties fairly for their contributions.
    - You remove the README.md provided with the assignment (delete it entirely from your github history), as you'll want your own readme anyway.

## Logistics

- I can only grade what you have **pushed** to your repo and with the latest timestamp.

## Monorepo

A monorepo is known as a 'monolithic' repository. Comapnies like Google for instance have nearly all of their code from every single employee in one single repository. Some companies choose to have many separate repositories. Which strategy would you think is better? Take a moment to think about it, and you can read more on the 'why' (at least for Google) and other companies below:
