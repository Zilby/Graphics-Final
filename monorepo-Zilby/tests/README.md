# Tests directory

This is some infrastructure for testing various assignments and labs. Mostly this directory is used as a way for me
(your instructor) to deliver git hooks on a per assignment/lab/activity/etcectera basis.

Hacking this directory, deleting its contents, and making modifications will unlikely benefit you in any way other than causing major headaches for you and the instructors. You have been warned :)

At the very least, you have learned that git hooks are a useful tool for continuous integration.
